# Verilog testbench generator
## Overview
Electronic Design Automation course project is a Python script that generates a Verilog testbench file using the HDLParse library. The generated testbench can be used to simulate the behavior of a digital logic design described in Verilog .

## Installation
- To use this script, you will need to have Python and the HDLParse library installed on your system.
- Another way to use this script by downloading the **executable file** and using it directly without any prerequisites.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- HDLParse library
- You can install the dependencies by running the following command:
  - `pip install hdlparse`


## Important Note
 - This script doesn't generate a correct testbench if the verilog code has `clk` (_may be we implement it soon_)
